While Recently browsing reddit.com/r/askreddit I came across an interesting post, it was a post titled : How do you deal with hindsight feelings of shame, regret and/or embarrassment about something you said or did? serious replies only

I prefer questions with the serious tag and this was on the first page so I decided to have a look. I read this interesting post quoting Theodore Roosevelt, and a link to a TedEx talk linked here - [https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame?language=en]. I enjoy TedEx talks and although it's been a while since I looked at one, I decided to watch this one. For me the interesting part wasn't regarding shame but what shame can create and ultimately, said quote. There was an interesting point made regarding shame and from the point of a woman who spent her PhD studying shame, it's worth accepting this to a certain extent. However to paraphrase she mentiones, shame is saying I'm not good enough and ultimately our biggest critic is us. 

To rewind I mentioned that it's the start of a new year and an improved me, not a new me. A new me not possible, you're the same person, put the past behind you and start strong, improve yourself everyday and do something that makes you or someone around you happy, every single day. Wake up and go a walk, go to the gym, visit a family member or friend anything that makes you feel good. Everyday I wake up and I do something, no matter how small, I say to myself well thats an improvement on yesterday. This quote(and talk) gave me a sort of self-validation and a lot of confidence, what I'm doing is right, I may have my critics, I may have people who will ridicule me when I make a mistake, however they will never taste my success because they haven't put in my effort. I grind to get results and no matter how hard I fall, I always recover, "because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds;" and whether I succeed or fail, I know that I gave my all,"who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
Ultimately I accept that my biggest critic is me. I'm the one who hits the lows and I'm the one who comes down hard on myself, harder than any other. When discussing this quote a friend said to me, "The lion comes in many forms", we all have trials and trivualtions, but stand up, raise your head and face your lion.

Coincidentally I also read this article the next day - [http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/01/09/manvotional-the-choice-of-hercules/]. I believe this shows that when faced with a difficult decision, sometimes the easy option is most desired, however it is not as satisying as working and earning what we have. For me so far I have stuck to my resolutions and again it's an improved me, not a new me I get up and if I go a cycle or a walk, thats 10 mins/ 1 hour fitter than I was beforehand, I track my calories and I get to work I put on my headphones and I get on with it. I maticulousy plan my days eating, I go to the gym after work, I stretch, I workout. Everyday I feel like a better me, there are days I don't go to the gym but I make a point of going a walk. There are going to be mistakes, I'm gonna fall down, but it's how I recover that matters most to me. To me, this quote keeps me going, I woke up and I went for an hour cycle, and when I get to work, I will work until I physically can't do anymore, but this is all leading up to huge rewards and honestly, I love the grind and I love pushing myself to discover my limits, but everyday I have my little winning moments, I love a good bowl of oats with peanut butter and nutella, a nice cup of coffee and a little John Mayer, to me this is what keeps me going everyday. and who knows what the future holds? Just be a better person than yesterday and in general be nice and talk to people, brighten up someone elses day, never hold grudges and always forgive after all a mistake is a mistake and this is natural for humans. 

This is just my take on things and how I try to live everyday, but every individual has their own opinions and advice,

George
