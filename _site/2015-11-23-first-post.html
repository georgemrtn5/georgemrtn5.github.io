	  <p>As of today it’s the 23rd of November. This means that Winter is coming…</p>

<p><img src="/img/post1/stark.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Game of Thrones" /></p>

<p>It’s soon to be December, and of course this means we are ending 2015 and coming into a new year in January. This time of the year always reminds me of 3 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Cold dark mornings and cold dark evenings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Christmas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New Year</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Cold and dark mornings, yes, we arise from sleep and try to get out of bed, but the cold air sears our skin and it’s hard to get out from under the blanket. Of course by the time we get washed and ready to head to work as the sky is still black and the street lights glow, the car is frozen over and that means getting the kettle. As the morning progresses the roads are icy and our breath lingers before us in the air, as though the soul is attempting to escape the freezing vessel that is the body. Maybe thats just me. When we leave work the darkness  descends and the bitingly cold air nips at the exposed skin. There is however a silver lining, the bad weather seems to make that morning cup of coffee and warm bowl of oats all the more satisfying, there is nothing more soothing than being warm and comfortable and look out to the bad weather be it raining or snowing, and knowing that you are sheltered. It seems that winter is a time for comfort; the warming food, the early nights and the extra time spent with family (although this may be a little forced due to the weather). I enjoy winter, to a certain extent, it’s the time of the year I feel at my most comfortable and of course this leads me to Christmas.</p>

<p>As cheesy as it is, it’s the time of the year when we should be giving. As I’ve got older I’ve began to enjoy giving presents a lot more than receiving presents, it’s knowing you brought a smile to a loved  ones face, that you lifted their spirits and as a result, there is the reward of that warm fuzzy feeling inside. The Dutch have the same idea on birthdays   <a href="http://netherlandsbynumbers.com/2013/03/17/essential-things-2-five-rules-for-dealing-with-dutch-birthdays/">[1]</a> It is customary to bring the cake in the event of your birthday, this also happens in some offices, where you bring in buns and hand them out on your birthday, which might lead to a few extra pounds. For me, Christmas is always a beautiful time of the year, the lights within the city centre, the trees and the colorful array of decorations. However no feeling comes close to that of Christmas day, stuffing yourself with sweets first thing in the morning, having dinner and eating so much food you nearly pass out and telling yourself you couldn’t eat another bite and then moving onto dessert, then comes the leftover sandwiches and a cold beer. To me that’s my ideal Christmas day.</p>

<p>Finally we come to the New Year, with the extra weight and a fresh start looming, comes the resolutions. We start with good intentions, I’m gonna lose weight or I’m gonna run a 10k, it could be a new hobby, a new interest, a new promise to ourselves. Ultimately we want to improve our lives, better ourselves, be better than last year and evolve. The New Year presents a fresh start, a clean slate. I have a few things in mind, and even if it is only me reading, I’ll keep updating posts, bettering myself and improving my life</p>
