	  <p>Todays topic, technology!! Spreadsheets and fitbit</p>

<p><img src="/img/post4/fitbitlogo.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Using technology" /></p>

<p>How does technology aid motivation? I prefer to say motivation, because everyone has different goals. As of Christmas, I bought a Fitbit and for over 2 years I’ve been using Excel spreadsheets to tracks weight goals and also lifting goals, the spreadsheet works out my Macronutrients and whether I’m cutting, maintaining or bulking, I get my calories, fat, protein and carb goals. I also use intermittent fasting which I’ll talk about in a later post.</p>

<p>So first of all, technology in general. Does mobile technology help motivation, short answer is yes. It helps in many areas, for example, with work I get my emails so I’m easily contacted at any time. With fitness, I can track calories with myfitnesspal, and now I can sync up my fitbit. It’s ridiculously easy. I honestly believe the fitbit is quite a useful device, it tracks my steps, my heart rate, my sleep and also connects to myfitnesspal to sync my diet. It is all so easy and visually appealing. Now the issues I see that others have with fitbit is the accuracy however the Fitbit will only help you, for example my goal is to get my resting heart rate below 60, I like to make sure I get 8 hours sleep and 10k steps per day. I take all results as estimations because there will be a margin of error, however I find that it keeps me motivated and when I’m lazy it makes me feel bad so therefore I go out of my way to correct this. Yes, there can be inaccuracies but it won’t be off by 5000 steps for example, people like to make excuses and blame others for their faults, and thus they can blame Fitbit.</p>

<p>This year I had two goals, track calories all year, yes the fitbit helps me do this, and get down to 76kg. I was 78kg to begin so it wasn’t a big deal to get down, but I started from bulking calories, to maintenance calories and then to cutting, this was to check my excel macros were accurate. The aim is to cut to 76 then maintain, I’m 6 weeks into my 12 week phase trial and believe I’ll go below 76kg so that’s a bonus however my next goal will be to hit all PRs this year, keep a clean bulk and try to maintain weight while benching over 100kg. On Sunday 7th February, I got 95kg for 3 reps. I was quite happy with this. I set realistic goals and try to hit them.</p>

<p>I think my excel sheet is the best thing I have when managing my weight. Again like the Fitbit it keeps me motivated and it was the big reason I got my weight down from 89KG to 72kg. Everyday I’ll track and count calories and from that I have a flexible diet and if I eat slightly bad food, I compensate with leaner and cleaner foods that night. I think, using the Fitbit and Excel sheet, have been very good with keeping me focused and motivated, I see progress everyday and because I wear the Fitbit I’ll make sure that I don’t deviate too much. The key is consistency. I started off at 78kg and went on a 15% calorie increase (bulking), I did this for 4 weeks, then moved to maintenance for 4 weeks, after maintaining I will go onto a week and hopefully lose 1kg per week, from there I will see how I feel, whether I can keep cutting or change my macros for maintenance.</p>

<p>So far my new year has been promising in terms of my goals, after these 12 weeks are up, I want to post regarding dieting and why as a concept it’s flawed and it is part of the reason behind my phasing trials, I will definitely be updating my progress with phasing,</p>
